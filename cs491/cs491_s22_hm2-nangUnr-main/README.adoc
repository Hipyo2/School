== Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work off another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.

* Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.

Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrollment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
