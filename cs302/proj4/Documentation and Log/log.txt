//The values are created and inserted into the left leaning red black tree. 
//After the insertion and proper rotations, it outputs the value, color of the node, the parent node value, and the color of the parent node. 
//This is done 10 times. 
//The drawing in my documentation better reflects what is happening to the tree. The value of 252 becomes the new root after rotating.

//This is the outputted inorder traversal of the tree after the 4th inserted value is removed.
//The Tree removes the value of 93 which does not change the tree in terms of rotations due to it being a red node at the bottom of the tree. 
//values 11 and 261 remain red nodes and the tree does not change except there is no node with value 93
